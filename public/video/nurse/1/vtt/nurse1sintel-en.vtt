00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:25.550
>> This is my first medical log.

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:29.470
It's day 540, I think.

00:00:29.471 --> 00:00:32.460
No new infections today.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.880
But we lost Kate.

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.310
And I've been chosen
to replace her.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.145
Medical log 543.

00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:04.695
No new blood plague
infections today,

00:01:04.696 --> 00:01:09.400
but lots of new tools and meds.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.750
Okay. We're almost there.

00:01:17.751 --> 00:01:20.750
Hang on, we're almost there.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.700
Medical log 560.

00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:50.820
I am attempting to
practice my stitches.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.100
The irony here, if this
qualifies for irony,

00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:59.720
is that my dad told me
to go to med school.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.055
Guys. Are we clear out there?

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:23.625
>> We're clear. Run.

00:02:23.626 --> 00:02:27.810
>> Medical log.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.200
Never go scavenging with Kevin,

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.860
because you'll
dislocate a shoulder.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:46.240
And now I'm going to
attempt to reset it.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.940
>> Go, go, run, run, run.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.220
>> They took everything.
