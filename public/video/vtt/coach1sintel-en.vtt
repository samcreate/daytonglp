>> If you're watching this,

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:15.700
then there's something
you should know,

00:00:15.701 --> 00:00:21.520
some of the things that we've
learned about survival.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:23.960
And like Mr. Ed has
said, our only hope

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:25.470
is that others will

00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:30.230
find these journals and
learn from our mistakes.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.910
I suspect you'd done things
you wish you'd never done.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:52.480
But even if morale and

00:00:52.481 --> 00:00:56.132
supllies are low, you can
still keep your spirits high,

00:00:56.133 --> 00:01:00.925
because there's a fire
that burns inside of you.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:03.280
You tend it to keep it warm.

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:06.460
Because if the fire goes out.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200
The key to success out
there, starts here.

00:01:35.201 --> 00:01:43.460
You visualize, you bring
your hatchet back. And then.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.290
Good news, we've got nutrition.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.160
Bad news: Zed
got a piece of me.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.790
Blood plague.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.940
It is imporant to me...

00:02:56.941 --> 00:03:01.000
to let you know that...
people here...

00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:12.780
have survived this by
helping one another.

00:03:12.781 --> 00:03:14.330
We're the good guys.
